# Toronto Waste Wizard Database Browser
## Overview
This app allows you to query the Toronto Waste Wizard Database. The concept comes from the [Web Engineer Challenge - Summer 2019](https://cdn.shopify.com/static/web-eng-challenge-summer-2019/index.md) by Canadian company Shopify. The challenge is part of the application process for an internship in the Summer of 2019.
